# Summary week 2
For this week i tried to implements new parameters and MLflow to log the results.

## Observations


## Reflection
I had some trouble with my uv.lock file first. After fixing that, i tried using MLflow to log the results. This was not realy smooth, and costed me a lot of time.
After setting it all up, it didnt show me any information.
So i just tried to code some hyperparameter testing.

In class i have to ask Raoul about the mlflow link, so i can review my tests.
