# Summary week 3

## Observations
While looking at the hyperparameters, i tried doubleing some after the first run. The first run i saw that the accuracy could easily improve, it did already in the firdt run but it needed a lot of epochs. Doubeling the hyperparameters made the model qay quicker. with these hyperparameters:

        input_size=3,
        hidden_size=256,
        num_layers=2,
        output_size=20,
        dropout=0.2,
    
I got to 98,44% accuracy withing 9 epochs.
